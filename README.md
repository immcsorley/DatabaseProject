# DatabaseProject


This is an overview of the Microsoft Access database I built for the University of Iowa's Nursing Residency Program. They wanted a relational database that made it easier to track organizaitons using their program, sales information, contact information, and more. Over the spring semester in 2022 I learned how to create this database and implement their current data into the database in order to help them analyze and use their data more efficiently.
