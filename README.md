## Overview
This is an overview of the Microsoft Access database I built for the University of Iowa's Nursing Residency Program. They wanted a relational database that made it easier to track organizaitons using their program, sales information, contact information, and be able to easily gain insights for the organization. Over the spring semester in 2022 I learned how to create this database and implement their current data into the database in order to help them analyze and use their data more efficiently. 
### Insights for the Company
This new database allows to better track the data that they already had. Before, it was a very manual process to look through excel in order to gain insights and change data, now, I have automated many reports and it just takes the click of a button to generate reports for the business.<br/>
These automated reports are built from queries and include: 
- Fiscal Sales Report
- Monthly Sales Reports
- Sales and number of residents by organization (customer)
- Organization reports such as completion percentage and how much money recieved from each customer 
- Product reports such as how much money recieved for one product vs another
- Revenue recieved by state

### Tracking Customers <br/>
The database also allows for the company to easily search and find customers, view or change data such as address, contact information, etc. The database also tracks each organization and is linked to other tables such as Invoices, Site Coordinators, and Residents for each customer.<br/>
### Invoicing
I built a form where the user can input the organization they would like to invoice and choose the amount requested along with other details of the sale, and Access will automatically create an invoice by using a template that I made and be ready to email it out to the customer. This is a far quicker process than what the company had been doing in the past.
